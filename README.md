##Questions and assumption
This test was done outside of work hours so I made a few assumptions.

Form field validation required? - ability to add form validation added with basic validation in place for noe.

What happens on cancel? - decided to just clear the form on cancel

What should happen on success? - Choose to leave for populated for now

What happens on success and error? - Notification shown

Should I be able to add multiple employees? - Designed to allow for this feature to be added easily

Default values on dates? - None given

Guarantor section is in design, but not in part 1 of spec? - Added it just to be safe.
